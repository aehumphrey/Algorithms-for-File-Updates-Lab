# Algorithms for File Updates Lab

## Objective

The goal of the Vulnerability Assessment Report project is comprehensively identify and evaluate potential security weaknesses within an organization.By conducting a systematic analysis of network configurations, software systems, and operational practices, the assessment aims to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in file handling operations such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files using Python's built-in functions.
- Competence in manipulating strings and text data extracted from .txt files.
- Ability to design and optimize algorithms for efficient updating of .txt files, particularly when handling large volumes of data.
- Skill in documenting code effectively through comments and docstrings for readability and maintenance purposes.
- Understanding of different file formats and parsing techniques, depending on the structure and content of the .txt file being updated.
- Application of Python programming skills to practical scenarios involving file manipulation and data processing tasks.
