# Algorithms for File Updates Lab

## Objective

In this scenario, access to restricted content is controlled via IP address. The “allow_list.txt” file contains these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have authorization. I created an algorithm in Python to automate updating the “allow_list.txt file.”

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in file handling operations such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files using Python's built-in functions.
- Competence in manipulating strings and text data extracted from .txt files.
- Ability to design and optimize algorithms for efficient updating of .txt files, particularly when handling large volumes of data.
- Skill in documenting code effectively through comments and docstrings for readability and maintenance purposes.
- Understanding of different file formats and parsing techniques, depending on the structure and content of the .txt file being updated.
- Application of Python programming skills to practical scenarios involving file manipulation and data processing tasks.

## Steps

### Step One

Description: Open the file that contains the allow list

### Step Two

Description: Read the file contents

### Step Three

Description: Convert the string into a list

### Step Four

Description: Iterate through the remove list

### Step Five

Description: Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

### Step Six

Description: Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
